        I’m probably not the best at expressing my love, nor the perfect boyfriend. But you are the best thing to ever come into my life. These six years have been a rollercoaster ride, but I wouldn’t have wanted to share it with anyone else but you. Six years down, probably sixty more to go, and countless afterlives beyond that. Every day, I wake up knowing you're in my life, and you are truly the most precious thing I have. I wouldn’t trade you for anything in this world. Thank you for sticking by me through thick and thin. I love you more than words can say.<br><br>
        Will you be my Valentine this year, and my wife somewhere in the future?</p>
